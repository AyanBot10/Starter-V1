# Starter-V1

Starter-V1 BOT is a versatile Telegram bot project designed by me (SatoX69). Unlike a few other bot, this project does not have any obfuscation or encrypted chunks or code. This project does not use any external APIs and is fully self depended.

## Features

- **Respond to Command Initialization**: The bot listens and responds to messages starting with a slash (/) and will notify the user if it's a valid command or not.
- **Integration with no such External Services or Third-party APIs**: The Project uses First-party modules and codes to run commands hence a lower latency.
- **Database Integration**: This project has both SQLITE and MONGODB Databases. It uses them both efficiently (MongoDB part still needs some fix). Use SQLite with json structure data for convenience.
